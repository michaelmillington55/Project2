# Project2
CS120 Project
This project made a clock that you can change the time of and show in 12 hour and 24 hour format. I believe I did well in the way I formatted the program. Some of the code could be simplified in the functions. This project could be used as an example whenever I once again open Visual Studio for classwork or a future job. I made it readable by using correct spacing.
